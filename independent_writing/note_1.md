## Paragraph1 - The Grand Opening

  - intriguing
- **Transition**
- Points

- Templet

  - 对方的事实/现象/细节

    - 引出对方立场
    - **Intriguing**

    <span style="font-size:1rem; background:skyblue;">It is hard to deny that (对方的细节）and such a fact may mislead impressionable people to generate the opinion that **(opposite response)**</span>

    In modern days, it might appear to some that ____; others maintain that____.

  - 指出对方的问题 （转折）

    - **Coherence**

    <span style="font-size:1rem; background:pink;">However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.</span>

    While these ideas have their base, they need to be scrutinized before we reach a conclusion.

  - 从以下分论点中，我觉得我的意见是跟你不一样的，是…

    - **Clear**

    <span style="font-size:1rem; background:yellowgreen;">As far as (Point1), (Point 2), and (Point 3) are concerned, I strongly hold that (our response).</span>

    From my point of view, the advantages of ___ outweigh its drawbacks in terms of (Point1), (Point 2), and (Point 3).

  - Example

    It is hard to deny that <span style="color:blue">infrastructure projects create lots of jobs for a society</span>, and such a fact may mislead impressionable people to generate the opinion that <span style="color:blue">our government **should give priority of** its investment to infrastructure **instead of** education</span>.

    However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.

    As far as <span style="color:blue">effectiveness</span>, <span style="color:blue">economy</span>, and <span style="color:blue">equality</span> are concerned, I strongly hold that <span style="color:blue">our government should divert resources to education</span>.

    In modern days, it might appear to some that the tax we pay is wasted on such expensive measures. While this idea have their base, they need to be scrutinized meticulously before we reach a conclusion. In my opinion, the advantages of the development significantly outweigh its drawbacks in terms of economy, effectiveness, and privacy.

    <span style="font-size:1rem; background:yellowgreen;">Not to mention the fact that these highly educated citizens will be able to build better, stronger, and more efficient infrastructure in the future to serve the whole society.</span>

    <span style="font-size:1rem; background:skyblue;">In addition, if we do not place enough weight on education, we will lack momentum in our future development, not only in the building of infrastructure but many other fields as well.</span>

    <span style="font-size:1rem; background:yellow;">(This is exactly the reason why we should spend more in education.)</span>

    Take the case of Union, which once diverted a huge amount of fund to education in science and engineering. As a result, educated people in the Union built a stronger country with a solid industry.
  
    Had it not been for Union’s heavy emphasis on education, Union would never become a leading entity in the world.
  
  - Furthermore, the fact that education promotes the fundamentals of economic growth in the long-term indicates that the government should allocate resources to education.
  
    Take the case of Union, which once diverted a huge amount of fund to education in science and engineering.

Alex honed both his leadership and communication skills through participating in various activities. As a result, he received offers from multiple elite firms upon his graduation.
  - Had it not been for Alex’s fondness in social activities, he would never become an elite professional as he is today.

## Paragraph 4&5 - Concession and Ending

### Concession

- Definition
  - The “Yes…” before “But…”
  - 欲扬先抑
  
- Example
  - **Your point**: Cats are better pets than dogs.
  - **Your concession**: <span style="color:red">**Yes**</span>, dogs can bit and defend you.
  - **Your true opinion**: <span style="color:red">**But**</span>… innocent people can get hurt, and we have police! Let’s keep cats!
  
- Templet
  - <span style="font-size:1rem; background:yellow;">Nevertheless, a voice arises that **(opposite detail in grand opening)**.</span>
  - <span style="font-size:1rem; background:yellow;">Ironically, **(fact(s) against opposite detail)**.</span>
  - <span style="font-size:1rem; background:yellow;">Therefore, **(Point3)**.</span>
  
- Example
  - Nevertheless, a voice arises that investment in infrastructure projects helps increase employment rate, boosting economy and creating better social equality.
  
    Ironically, the jobs added through such projects are only temporary, and do not help people in the long term. Poor people and their future generations still cannot move up in the social echelon.
  
    Therefore, education is the true solution to tackle inequality in the society.
  
  - Nevertheless, a voice arises that education can help people to move up in the social hierarchy, create better social equality.
  
    Ironically, schools have to be built, roads have to be paved, and communication systems established before we launch programs on education. In addition, workers on infrastructure projects are often paid better than those hired by private companies.
  
    Therefore, investment in infrastructure not only creates jobs in the near term, but lays out the future path for a better society with less inequality.

### ~~The End~~

In a nutshell, I maintain that

Admittedly, different people have different opinions, and some people may oppose me.

However, I believe they will compromise after being exposed to my article.

## Summary



Example:

**It is hard to deny that infrastructure projects can create jobs for a society, and such a fact may mislead impressionable people to generate the opinion that our government should give priority of its investment to infrastructure instead of education. However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously. As far as effectiveness, economy, and equality are concerned, I strongly hold that our government should divert its investment to education.**

**First and foremost, education is more effective than infrastructure in changing the world, as education generates greater long-term welfare for the society we live in. Meanwhile, In the long term, people will be able to learn more knowledge, enhance their professional skills, and change the world they live in; Not to mention the fact that these highly educated citizens will be able to build better, stronger, and more efficient infrastructure in the future to serve the whole society. If we do not place enough weight on education, we will lack momentum in our future development, not only in the building of infrastructure but many other fields as well.**

**Furthermore, the fact that education promotes the fundamentals of economic growth in the long-term indicates that the government should allocate resources to education. Take the case of Soft Union, which once diverted a huge amount of fund to education in science and engineering. As a result, educated people, such as Tupolev, revolutionized the framework of Soft Union’s industry and economy. These talents formed a synergy and transformed a poor country into one of the leading economies in the world. Had it not been for Soft Union’s heavy emphasis on education, Soft Union would never become a leading economy in the world.**

**Nevertheless, a voice arises that investment in infrastructure projects helps increase employment rate, boosting economy and creating better social equality. Ironically, the jobs added through such projects are only temporary, and do not help people in the long term. Poor people and their future generations still cannot move up in the social echelon. Therefore, education is the true solution to tackle inequality in the society.**

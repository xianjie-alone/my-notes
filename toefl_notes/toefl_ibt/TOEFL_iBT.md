- You’ll need to close all doors in the room before beginning the test.

- Dress appropriately for your test. You'll be monitored via camera by the proctor, and your photo will be shared with institutions that receive your scores.

- You **may not** take notes on regular paper, for security purposes.

- You may use one of the following to take notes:

- **Before you attempt to check in for your test:
  • Run a final ProctorU equipment check and fix any issues. All issues must be resolved before your appointment
  time.

- **At your appointment time, click the “start my test” link in your appointment order confirmation email or on the Appointment Details page in your ETS Account. You’ll have up to 12 minutes after your scheduled time to begin your check in. If you haven’t checked in by that time, your test will be canceled and your fee won’t be refunded.**

- **Computer firewalls and security applications can interfere with the test delivery software. If you experience this issue, you may need to disable or reconfigure your applications prior to test.**

  

# Identification (ID) Requirements for the TOEFL iBT Test

**Your ID requirements depend on where you plan to take the test and your country of citizenship.**

**You must present a valid passport with your name, photograph and signature as your primary ID.**

**If you’re testing in a European Union, Schengen Zone, Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), or Mercosur country other than the one where you live, you can use your valid national or European identity card, if you have one. The card must include your name, a recognizable photograph, your date of birth and your signature. If the ID does not contain all of these items, you’ll need to present a supplemental ID.**



# TOEFL iBT Reading Section

**It includes three or four reading passages, each approximately 700 words long, with 10 questions per passage. You have 54 to 72 minutes to answer all the questions in the section.**

## Reading Factual/Negative Factual Information

**Factual Information questions** ask you to recognize information that is explicitly stated in the text.

These may include facts such as：

- Major ideas
- Supporting details
- Definitions

Factual Information questions will have phrases like：

- According to the paragraph
- Paragraph X answers which of the following

Here are some tips for answering factual information questions:

- Don’t select an answer just because it contains words or phrases from the paragraph.
- Evaluate each option to determine if it is correct.



**Negative factual information questions** are similar, except that, instead of only one answer being true, three of the four answers are true, and you have to determine which one is false.

Negative Factual Information questions will have phrases like：

- According to the paragraph, which of the following is NOT true?
- The author mentions all of the following EXCEPT

Here are some tips for answering negative factual information questions:

- Answer is either not in the paragraph, or it contradicts information in the paragraph.

***Here is a tip to help you improve your reading skills:***

* Read news and magazine articles about various subjects as often as you can, and practice taking notes.

- when you take notes, you need to find out what is important, relevant or credible?
- Keep the notes short to help you remember important facts

## Reading Inference and Rhetorical Purpose Questions

**Inference questions** ask you to identify information or comprehend an idea that is not explicitly stated in the reading passage.

You can recognize inference questions because they usually include the words "infer," "imply" or "suggest," like in these examples:

- Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about X?
- The author of the paragraph implies that X…
- Paragraph X suggests which of the following about Y?

**Rhetorical purpose questions** are similar, because they also ask for information not explicitly stated. These will ask:

- Why does the author mention X?

***Tips:***

* One way to approach these types of questions, if you can't identify the correct answer immediately, is to eliminate wrong answers. 

* One way to build your reading skills is by practicing skimming, which is reading quickly to identify major points. One way to skim is to read the introductory paragraph, then the first sentence of each of the middle paragraphs, and then read the concluding paragraph.

* When you're practicing, try reading a passage twice, the first time skimming to get the main ideas, then read it again more carefully to see if you really DID get those main ideas.

* Another tip that will help with rhetorical purpose questions is to make sure you know the definition of these words, because they are often used to describe kinds of rhetorical purposes:
  * To illustrate
  * To explain
  * To contract
  * To refute
  * To note
  * To support

## Reading Vocabulary Question

Vocabulary questions ask you to identify the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the reading passage.

It's easy to identify Vocabulary questions, because there will be a word or phrase highlighted in the reading passage, and you will see questions like these, with phrases like "closest in meaning" or "the author means."：

- The word "X" in the passage is closest in meaning to…
- The phrase "X" in the passage is closest in meaning to…
- In stating "X", the author means that…

***Tips:***

The best general strategy to be ready for this type of questions is to build your vocabulary.

Many English words come from Latin or Greek. So if you study Latin and Greek roots that will help you remember the meanings of words. And it can also help you figure out the meanings of words you may not know.

Latin and Greek roots of English words

| Root word | Origin | Meaning | Examples and Definitions        |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| bio       | Greek  | life    | Biology- science of life        |
| cardi     | Greek  | heart   | Cardiac - relating to the heart |
| retro     | Latin  | back    | Retrospect - review past events |
| vac       | Latin  | empty   | Vacant – not occupied           |

## Reading Sentence Simplification Question

Sentence Simplification questions ask you to identify a sentence that has essentially the same meaning as a sentence from the reading passage. The correct answer choice contains the main ideas from the sentence in the passage but may leave out minor or unimportant details. It should restate the most important information in a simpler way.

- Correct answer contains the main ideas restated in a simpler way

Answering this type of question will require you to understand the relationship between the pieces of information in the sentence.
Often, there is an important cause/effect relationship, or there may be a conclusion based on some evidence. So look for those same ideas in the answer choices.

- Cause/effect
- Conclusion based on evidence

***Tips:***

One tip to build your reading skills, which will also help you answer sentence simplification questions, is to look at complex sentences or paragraphs, and separate the main ideas from less important information.

Non-essential information can be things like examples, or text in parentheses, or very specific information like numbers or dates:

- Examples
- Parentheses
- Numbers/dates

## Reading Insert Text Question

The Insert Text questions are designed to show that you understand the logical order of ideas in a reading passage.

In the reading section, every reading passage has one Insert Text question. But instead of choosing from a list of 4 choices, like with most Reading questions, you will click on one of the 4 black squares to insert the text into the paragraph.

***Tips:***

One tip for improving your reading is to really know your pronouns, and to practice matching them to the words they refer to in a text.Here are a few of the most common pronouns that you will see when you read:

- This/these
- That/those
- They/them
- Him/her
- He/she/it
- Which
